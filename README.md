Dashing Widgets
===============

Custom widgets I've built for [Dashing](http://dashing.io), the open-source Sinatra-based dashboard framework. Originally built as part of [Rigor's internal engineering dashboard](http://rigor.com/blog/2014/08/internal-dashboard-kpis-apis-raspberry-pis), these widgets are now free for everyone to use, so go crazy.
